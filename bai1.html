<h1>I like to go swimming in the summer</h1>
<p>Swimming is my most favorite activity in the summer. When the sun is shining <br> and the air is warm, you will find me dipping into my backyard pool. It's not an <br> impressive pool, only three feet deep, but it's mine.</p>
<p>There are three reason i like to swim:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I get lots of exercise</li>
	<li>I enjoy the freedom</li>
	<li>I have an opportunity to be in the sun.</li>
</ul>
